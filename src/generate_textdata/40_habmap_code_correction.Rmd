# Correction of codes in Habitat map

For some polygons in the habitat map the vegetation type is not certain. When 
this is the case, the code contains the possible vegetation types separated with
a ','. However, in some cases this way of coding is not used. In that case we
change the code according to the general coding rules (for example 3130_rbbmr is
changed to 3130,rbbmr). This makes processing of the habitat map more 
straightforward. 

```{r}
code_correction <-  gs_key("1Lltpq1_OQENZKrCmfDLuBiaZQ0_YCoGkFAqcOtFRdHg") %>%
  gs_read(ws = 1)


))
```
