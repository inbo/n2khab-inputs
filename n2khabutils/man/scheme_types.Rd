\title{Documentation of included data source 'scheme_types'}
\format{A vc-formatted data source. As such, it corresponds to
a dataframe with 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{scheme}{Code of the scheme, as a factor, and explained by
  \code{\link{namelist}}.
  It must be represented in \code{\link{schemes}}.
  }
  \item{type}{Code of the type, as a factor, and explained by
  \code{\link{namelist}}.
  It must be represented in \code{\link{types}}.}
  \item{typegroup}{An \emph{optional} code (and optionally explained by
  \code{\link{namelist}}),
  declaring the typegroup to which a type belongs \emph{within the specified
  scheme}.
  Typegroups point out which types are considered together as a group in
  inferences for the scheme at hand.}
}

Each combination of \code{scheme} and \code{type} must be unique.}

        \item{the link between schemes and types comes from

\description{
'scheme_types' is a data source in the
\href{https://inbo.github.io/git2rdata/index.html}{vc-format} which lists
the types (using the type-code from \code{\link{types}}) that belong to
each N2KHAB (monitoring or research) scheme (using the scheme-code from
\code{\link{schemes}}).
It also defines typegroup memberships of the types within specific schemes,
if applicable.
The codes of schemes and types (and optionally: typegroups)
are explained in the
data source \code{\link{namelist}} (which can accommodate multiple
languages).
