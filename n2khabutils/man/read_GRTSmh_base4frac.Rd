\title{Return the processed data source \code{GRTSmh_base4frac} as a
RasterLayer}
\usage{
read_GRTSmh_base4frac(path,
  file = "20_processed/GRTSmh_base4frac/GRTSmh_base4frac.tif")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Location of the file.
Considering the default value of the \code{file} argument, use this argument
in scripts to set the location of the folder '\strong{\code{data}}'.}

\item{file}{The filename of the data source.
May include a path prefix.
The default follows the data management advice in the
\href{https://github.com/inbo/n2khab-inputs}{n2khab-inputs} repository.}
}
\value{
A RasterLayer with 21041043 cells.
}
\description{
The \code{GRTSmh_base4frac} data source is like a mirror to
\code{GRTSmaster_habitats}, holding the ranking numbers as base 4 fractions.
The function returns it as a RasterLayer.
}
\details{
The data source file, read by the function, is a monolayered GeoTIFF in the
\code{FLT8S} datatype.
In \code{GRTSmh_base4frac}, the decimal (i.e. base 10) integer values from
the raster data source \code{GRTSmaster_habitats} (see
\code{\link{read_GRTSmh}}) have been converted into base 4 fractions,
using a precision
of 13 digits behind the decimal mark (as needed to cope with the range of
values).
For example, the integer \code{16} (\code{= 4^2}) has been converted into
\code{0.0000000000100} and \code{4^12} has been converted into
\code{0.1000000000000}.

Long base 4 fractions seem to be handled and stored easier than long
(base 4) integers.
This approach follows the one of Stevens & Olsen (2004) to represent
the reverse hierarchical order in a GRTS sample as base-4-fraction addresses.

Beware that not all GRTS ranking numbers are present in the data source, as
the original GRTS raster has been clipped with the Flemish outer borders
(i.e., not excluding the Brussels Capital Region).

# 'GRTSmh_base4frac' data source is present in the default subdirectory.
# In all other cases, this example won't work but at least you can consider
# what to do.
