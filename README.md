## Welcome

This repo will hold data definitions and preprocessing steps that are necessary for analyses regarding Flemish Natura 2000 habitats and regionally important biotopes (RIBs). The repo is set up with a special interest in the design, review and analysis of Natura 2000 habitat monitoring programmes at the Flemish scale.

The repo is under construction.
